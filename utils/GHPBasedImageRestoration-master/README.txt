This code is for image restoration based on GHP method.


This code is from the CVPR2013 paper: 

Wangmeng Zuo, Lei Zhang, Chunwei Song, David Zhang, "Texture Enhanced Image Denoising via Gradient Histogram Preservation," in CVPR2013.

Please run "HMIS_Main.m" to show the demo of our algorithm.



Part of the code is from the following work:

W. Dong, L. Zhang, G. Shi and X. Li, ¡§Nonlocally Centralized Sparse Representation for Image Restoration¡¨, 
IEEE Trans. on Image Processing, vol. 22, no. 4, pp. 1620-1630, Apr. 2013.
W. Dong, L. Zhang and G. Shi, ¡§Centralized Sparse Representation for Image Restoration,¡¨ in ICCV 2011.


We also thank Rody Oldenhuis for sharing his codes of bounded Nelder-Mead algorithm ("http://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/24298-optimize"), which is used by us in estimating the latent noiseless image gradient histogram.
